/* movie_player.h -- in-engine video playback for the intro/credits movies
 *
 * On Android the game plays its .m4v movies through the Java MediaPlayer on
 * a view above the game surface and just polls isMoviePlaying(). Here we
 * decode them with FFmpeg on a worker thread and overlay the frames right
 * before each eglSwapBuffers call.
